# Simple Hello, World! Python Code

def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

This code defines a function main() that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. The if __name__ == "__main__": block ensures that the main() function is executed when you run the Python script directly (not when it's imported as a module).
